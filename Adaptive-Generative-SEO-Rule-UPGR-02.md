# Adaptive‑Generative SEO Core Rule – UPGR‑02

This rule outlines the core principles for SEO when generating and adapting content using UpgradeFor AI.

- **Indexation**: Ensure all generated pages are discoverable by search engines. Provide clear metadata and use robots directives appropriately.
- **URL structure**: Create human-readable URLs that reflect the content hierarchy. Avoid unnecessary parameters and maintain consistent naming conventions.
- **Performance**: Monitor page performance (e.g., with Lighthouse) and optimize for loading speed. Compress images, minimize scripts, and leverage caching.
- **Mobile first**: Generate responsive designs that work seamlessly on mobile devices. Use adaptive layouts and test across screen sizes.
- **Semantic markup**: Include structured data (e.g., schema.org) when appropriate to enhance search snippets and improve ranking.
- **Reminders**: Regularly review and update content to reflect current SEO best practices. Use tools to monitor search ranking and adjust strategy accordingly.

By following these principles, UpgradeFor AI can produce SEO-friendly content that adapts over time and supports sustainable search visibility.
